/// Model for actions list.
///
/// To create list just call the `init(senderView:sourceView:delegate:)` method, where:
/// * `senderView` is the view initiated the list presenting.
/// This view's alpha will be set to 0 before presenting to not be visible under `BackgroundView`
/// * `sourceView` is the copy of the `senderView`.
/// Source view will be displayed above the background view to not be dimmed or blurred with `BackgroundView`
/// List will appear with animation from under the source view and will be correctly placed in the view.
/// Also `sourceView` will "pulse" while presenting list (as the app icons on force tap).
///
/// Set up list appearance before presenting.
/// There is two ways to set up appearance:
/// * for all lists via the `ActionsListAppearance.List.common` structure
/// * for single list via the `appearance` property
///
/// To present list just call `present()` method. You could also provide completion handler or set the `delegate` to
/// handle list events.
///
/// To dismiss list just call `dismiss()` method. You could also provide completion handler or set the `delegate` to
/// handle list events.
///
/// If you have changed action's appearance, you should call `reloadActions()` method.
/// This method has no effect on list's appearance.
///
/// List generates feedback during presentation. To disable this see `FeedbackGenerator`.
///
/// ActionsListModel must be used from the main thread only.
///
/// For any kind of customizations see `ActionsListAppearance.List`.
