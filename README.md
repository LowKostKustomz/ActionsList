ActionsList is an iOS framework for presenting actions lists similar to Apple's Quick Actions menu. It presents and dismisses list with actions with animation from the source view.

It is the best replacement for the Android's floating action button in iOS if your app is following the iOS Design Guidelines.

## Features

* System-like look and feel:

>	- actions order is reverted if list is displayed in top part of the screen
>	- feedback is generated on list opening and action highlight (if device supports any feedback; can be disabled)
>	- blurred list background and background view (if device supports blur and "Reduce transparency" is off, otherwise dimmed view will be used, can be customized)
>	- source view pulses on list opening

* Reduce transparency mode support
* VoiceOver support
* Safe Areas support
* Universal (iPhone & iPad)
* Objective-C support
* Change orientation supported (not fully, see [**Known Issues**](#known-issues))
* Highly customizable:

>	- no actions count limits (contained in scroll view)
>	- list background color, action's appearance and background view can be changed

## Requirements

* Xcode 9.0 or later
* iOS 9.0 or later
* Swift 3.2 or later

## Known Issues and Important things

* List created with `UITabBarItem` extension method does not support orientation changes:

> Constraints to `UITabBarItem` do not work properly, so after orientation change `sourceView` and `senderView` will have different frames and content positions.

* `UIBarButtonItem`'s create list method is obsoleted since iOS 11:

> In iOS 11 `UIBarButtonItem` created with `image` or `title` initializer has wrong content frame, so `sourceView` will be a bit offset. Instead, use `init(customView:)` to create `UIBarButtonItem` with UIButton and create list with this button. In iOS 10 or earlier issue is not present.

![Demo Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LowKostKustomz/ActionsList/master/Assets/DemoScreenshot.png)

## Usage

```swift
// Importing framework
import ActionsList

// Save list model to a property or it will be deallocated and you will have no ability to control it outside of the scope list was created in
private var list: ActionsListModel? = nil

// Creating list in your method
private func method() {

	// For UIButton instance (must be in the view hierarchy)
	let list = uiButton.createActionsList()
	
	// For UITabBarItem instance (must be in the view hierarchy)
	let list = uiTabBarItem.createActionsList()
	
	// For UIBarButtonItem instance (must be in the view hierarchy)
	let list = uiBarButtonItem.createActionsList()
	
	// For your custom view (must be in the view hierarchy)
	let list = ActionsListModel(
	    senderView: viewThatEmittedListShowing, 
	    sourceView: copyOfSenderViewToShowAboveBackgroundView, 
	    delegate: actionsListDelegate)
	
	// Add actions to list in order to 
	list.add(action: ActionsListDefaultButtonModel(
	    localizedTitle: "Create Alarm",
	    image: UIImage(named: "Alarm clock"),
	    action: { action in                          
		// - To dismiss
		action.list?.dismiss()
	}))
	
	// Present list
	list.present()
	
	// Do not forget to save list model to the property
	self.list = list
}
```

## Customization

> [Wiki](https://github.com/LowKostKustomz/ActionsList/wiki) with more content and examples available

### List

To customize list background color use `ActionsListModel`'s `appearance` property or `ActionsListAppearance.List.common` to set default appearance.

### Actions

You can customize single action's appearance via `ActionsListDefaultButtonModel`'s `appearance` property or `ActionsListAppearance.Button.common` to set default appearance.

Action can be disabled, you can control it via the `ActionsListDefaultButtonModel`'s `isEnabled` property.

Actions generate feedback on highlight, to manage this see [**Feedback**](#feedback) section.

### Background View

You can create your own background view by implementing `ActionsListBackgroundView` protocol.

To change default dimmed view dimming color use `ActionsListAppearance.BackgroundView.common.dimmingColor`

### Feedback

List generates the same feedback on opening and action highlighting as system list.

To disable feedback generation use `FeedbackGenerator.instance.isEnabled` property.
